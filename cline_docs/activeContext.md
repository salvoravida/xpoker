# Active Context: X Poker React Remake - Initialization

## Current Focus

The current focus is on initializing the project and setting up the necessary Memory Bank documentation files. We are recreating a C++ poker game (`poker.cpp`, `POKER2.CPP`) using React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Recent Changes

-   Created `cline_docs/productContext.md` outlining the project goals and requirements based on the original C++ code and user request.
-   Confirmed the project name will be `xpoker`.

## Next Steps

1.  Create the remaining Memory Bank files:
    *   `cline_docs/systemPatterns.md`
    *   `cline_docs/techContext.md`
    *   `cline_docs/progress.md`
2.  Create the Vite project named `xpoker` using the React + TypeScript template.
3.  Begin implementing the core game logic and UI components based on the original C++ code and the `productContext.md`.
